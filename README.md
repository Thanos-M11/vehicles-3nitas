# Backend branch

## backend setup

- this `backend` branch simulates the API requests using `http://localhost:3000/` port.

- install npm on backend directory (only the first time)
- Run `npm start` for a BE server simulation.

## Development server

- Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Demonstration purposes delay

- Within `app.js` we have added an on purpose timeout of 2 seconds on each `get` request for demonstration purposes so as for the spinners to be rendered.
